// REMINDER, array indexes START AT 0 in C#.  So the first element will be of index 0.

// 1. Create a single-dimensional array of type int.  Populate it with 6 numbers.

// 2. Now pull out the 5th number in the array and store it in a variable of type int

// 3. Create a multi-dimensional int array with two rows, each row being 5 elements long
// Prepopulate it with data

// 4.  Now pull out the 3rd number in the 2nd row of that array and store it in a variable

// 5. Create a jagged array with 4 rows.  
// Make the 1st row 3 columns long
// Make the 2nd row 5 columns long
// Make the 3rd row 2 columns long
// Make the 4th row 4 columns long
// Prepopulate each row with data

// 6. Change the 3rd element in the 4th row.

// 7. Create a list of type string

// 8. Manually add 4 strings to the list.  Then remove the LAST 2 elements BY INDEX.

// 9. Create a dictionary where the key is of type int and the value is of type string.
// Populate it with 5 elements.

// 10.  Print any two values from the dictionary to the console.  You should pull them by key.
